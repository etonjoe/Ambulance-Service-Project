Steps to Create the Power BI Dashboard
Step 1: Install Power BI Desktop
Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official Microsoft Power BI site.

Step 2: Connect to Your SQL Server Database
Open Power BI Desktop.

Click on Home > Get Data > SQL Server.

Enter your Server Name and Database Name to connect to your SQL Server.

Choose the tables related to the ambulance service (e.g., Ambulances, Patients, EmergencyCalls, Dispatches).

Step 3: Data Transformation
Once the data is loaded, click Transform Data to open the Power Query Editor.

Clean the data:

Remove unnecessary columns.

Format columns to their appropriate data types (e.g., dates, numbers).

Create calculated columns such as ResponseTime = ArrivalTime - DispatchTime if needed.

Step 4: Create Calculated Measures Using DAX
In the Modeling tab, create the following calculated measures:

Available Ambulances:

DAX
Copy
AvailableAmbulances = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Ambulances, Ambulances[Status] = "Available"))
Average Response Time:

DAX
Copy
AverageResponseTime = AVERAGEX(Dispatches, DATEDIFF(Dispatches[DispatchTime], Dispatches[ArrivalTime], MINUTE))
Call Severity Distribution:

DAX
Copy
CallsBySeverity = COUNTROWS(EmergencyCalls)
Incident Resolution Time:

DAX
Copy
IncidentResolutionTime = AVERAGEX(Incidents, DATEDIFF(Incidents[IncidentTime], Incidents[ResolvedTime], HOUR))
Step 5: Design Your Dashboard
Add KPI Visuals:

Use Card visuals to show key metrics like the number of available ambulances, average response time, etc.

Bar/Column charts can be used to display emergency calls by severity, average response time by ambulance, etc.

Use a Line chart to show trends over time (e.g., response times over the past 30 days).

Add a Date Filter:

Use a Slicer to allow users to filter the dashboard by time (e.g., last 30 days, last 6 months).

Conditional Formatting:

Apply conditional formatting on key metrics like response time to visually highlight anomalies (e.g., response times above a certain threshold in red).

Step 6: Publish the Report
Once the dashboard is ready, save the Power BI report file with a .pbix extension.

Click Publish in Power BI Desktop to upload the report to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

Step 7: Set up Data Refresh
If you're using live or regularly updated data:

Set up automatic data refresh in Power BI Service to ensure that the dashboard is always up to date.
